1)To compile the client and serevr programs
    Type make in the directory where they are present.

2) To run the programs. The server is first run with the command ./server.sh <req-code> . The code prints out an available port.
For example ./server.sh 123
The server prints SERVER_PORT=1234


3) Using an available port mentioned by the server , use that to start the client application. 
For example ./client.sh ubuntu1404-004.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca 1234 123 "hello world". In this case the client is running on ubuntu1404-002.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca
If the request code sent by the client is correct, the client prints the following message 
Received from server via UDP protocol : dlrow olleh
